<h3>Some nice documents about research, enjoy the read!</h3>
<ul>
			<li><a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/content/aboutresearch/alon-chooseproblem.pdf" target="_blank"><b>How to choose a good scientific problem? (by Uri Alon)</b></a><br/>
			For most PhD students, finding a good problem to work on, or properly <i>defining</i> the problem that they solved or want to solved (indeed, it is not always causal), is the most difficult part about writing a thesis. However, thinking carefully about the problem is often more insightful and important than the solution to the problem itself. The linked article gives you some pointers on how to choose a good scientific problem.<br/></li>
			<li><a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/content/aboutresearch/Baez-advice4youngscientist.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Advice for young scientists. (by John Baez)</b></a><br/>
			Lovely document with some great advice, which feels sometimes trivial, but is good to take to heart. From the introductory paragraph: "Most of it applies to grad students and postdocs in any branch of science who seek an academic career involving research. The stuff on giving good talks will be helpful to almost all scientists, since most give pretty bad talks."</li>
			<li><a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/content/aboutresearch/dijkstra-3goldenrules.pdf" target="_blank"><b>The Three Golden Rules for Successful Scientific Research (by Edsger Dijkstra)</b></a><br/>
				Yes, <i>the</i> Dijkstra. Do I need to say more?</li>
			<li><a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/content/aboutresearch/hamming-unurresearch.pdf" target="_blank"><b>You and your research. (by Richard Hamming)</b></a><br/>
			A transcription of a seminar that Richard Hamming (yes, <i>the</i> Hamming) gave at Bell labs in 1986. Seems old, but is still very relevant. It considers the randomness and ambiguity of research and ideas in general and about persistency. It inspired me at least to only study the stuff I was <i>truly</i> interested in. Prioritize the ideas that you find important!</li>
			<li><a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/content/aboutresearch/hamming-genius.pdf" target="_blank"><b>A Stroke of Genius: Striving for Greatness in All You Do. (by Richard Hamming)</b></a><br/>
			Another work by Richard Hamming on how to achieve great things. In essence it is also finding the 'right' problem to work on. The document can be a bit overwhelming, but it contains plenty of food for thought.</li>
			<li><a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/content/aboutresearch/willems.pdf" target="_blank"><b>In Control, Almost from the Beginning Until the Day After Tomorrow. (by Jan C. Willems)</b></a><br/>
			I'm part of the Jan C. Willems fan club, and if you are too, you should read this article. Especially the epilogue sparks inspiration.
			</li>
			<li><a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/content/aboutresearch/ResearchBible.pdf" target="_blank"><b>The Researcher's Bible. (by Alan Bundy, Ben du Boulay, Jim Howe, and Gordon Plotkin)</b></a><br/>
			A nice compilation of advice from 1989 (this is a bit outdated, but still fun to read).</li>
			<li><a href="https://research.chrisverhoek.com/content/aboutresearch/bitterlesson.pdf" target="_blank"><b>The Bitter Lesson. (by Richard Sutton)</b></a><br/>
			Yes, <i>the</i> Sutton. This article, to me, was an eye-opener. The problem described in this note connects to so much more than just learning. In essence, Richard Sutton states that using learning architectures that are structured based on how humans think on the long run hinders progress. I believe that, at its core, this problem goes much deeper than 'just' learning methods. In the goal of understanding and grasping human intelligence, we <i>can</i> only think about human intelligence from our own perspective/structure. So, we end up with a paradox, a self-referential loop, where the only way of resolving it is stepping outside of the system (which is not really possible :P). Anyway, enjoy the read.

<p>None of these documents or advices are written up by me. I collected them over the years from many places (one important source was John Simpson-Porco's <a href="https://www.control.utoronto.ca/~jwsimpson/stuff.html" target="_blank">website</a>, thanks!) and put them only here to preserve them.</p>
